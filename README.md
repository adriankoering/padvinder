# padvinder
Learning how to raytrace with an object-orientated implementation in python. :dizzy:

## Usage
from the root of the repository run it via
```
python -m padvinder
```
this executes the \__main__.py file

to run the test execute the test module from the repository root via
```
python -m padvinder.test
```

# Todo List
1. Add Test for all sources
2. Copy sources from previous projects
3. Add Examples and Images to readme
4. Add Continuous Integration
5. Add those cute buttons to the readme
6. Speed-up with numba, cython, etc.
